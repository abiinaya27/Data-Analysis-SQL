# üõí Walmart Sales Data Analysis using SQL

## üìò Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing Walmart sales data** using **SQL** to gain insights into product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior across different branches.
The goal is to help understand key business metrics and improve sales strategies based on data-driven insights.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the **Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition**, which contains sales data from **three branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw**.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The main purpose of this project is to:

* Analyze **sales performance** across branches and products
* Identify **top-performing products and categories**
* Examine **customer behavior** and segmentation
* Understand the **impact of time, day, and month** on sales
* Suggest strategies for improving profitability and operational efficiency

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach and Methodology

### 1. üßπ Data Wrangling

* Checked for missing or NULL values
* Ensured proper data types for each column
* Created database and tables in SQL
* Defined all fields with `NOT NULL` constraints to maintain data integrity

### 2. üß† Feature Engineering

Generated additional columns to improve insights:

* `time_of_day` ‚Üí to analyze sales in Morning, Afternoon, and Evening
* `day_name` ‚Üí to find which day of the week each branch is busiest
* `month_name` ‚Üí to find the most profitable month of the year

### 3. üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used SQL queries to answer key business questions:

* Which product lines perform best?
* What are the top cities and branches by revenue?
* Which customer types bring in the most profit?
* Which payment methods are most used?
* What times of day see the highest sales?

## üìä Key Business Insights

### üõçÔ∏è Product Analysis

* Identified top-performing product lines and those needing improvement
* Found the most commonly used payment method
* Analyzed revenue, tax, and ratings by product line

### üí∞ Sales Analysis

* Determined total revenue and profit per month
* Found peak months and branches for sales
* Discovered that **VAT** and **COGS** influence total revenue trends

### üë• Customer Analysis

* Explored gender distribution and purchasing behavior
* Found that **Members** contribute higher revenue than **Normal customers**
* Identified which times of day and days of the week customers rate products highest

## üìà Revenue and Profit Calculations

Key formulas used in the analysis:

[
\text{COGS} = \text{Unit Price} \times \text{Quantity}
]

[
\text{VAT} = 5% \times \text{COGS}
]

[
\text{Total (Gross Sales)} = \text{COGS} + \text{VAT}
]

[
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Total} - \text{COGS}
]

[
\text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Total Revenue}}
]

---

## üß± SQL Implementation

The project includes an SQL script (`SQL_queries.sql`) that:

* Creates the **WalmartSales** database and **sales** table
* Inserts data from the dataset
* Performs analytical queries to answer business questions

Example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS walmartSales;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales(
    invoice_id VARCHAR(30) PRIMARY KEY,
    branch VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    customer_type VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    product_line VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    tax_pct FLOAT(6,4) NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    payment VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL
);
```

## üèÅ Conclusion

This SQL project demonstrates the use of **data wrangling**, **feature engineering**, and **analytical querying** to derive actionable insights from retail data.
It highlights how SQL can be used effectively to understand:

* Customer purchasing behavior
* Sales trends
* Profitability of product lines and locations

These insights can help businesses like Walmart **optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies**.
